The purpose of descriptive statistics is to quantitatively describe a collection of data by measures
of central tendency, measures of frequency, and measures of variability.

Let there be a system, called METRICSTICS (a portmanteau of METRICS and STATISTICS),
for finding m (minimum), M (maximum), o (mode), d (median), μ (arithmetic mean), MAD (mean absolute deviation), and σ (standard deviation). The system must take as input a random number of data
values and output its descriptive statistics.
